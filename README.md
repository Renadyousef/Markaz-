In today’s fast-paced digital world, attention spans are decreasing rapidly. Especially when short-form content like TikTok is prevalent. Many students struggle to focus during study sessions, feeling overwhelmed by lengthy textbooks and slides. Markas (مركز) Arabic study tool design to meet this challenge: an innovative, AI-powered study tool that transforms the learning experience. It streamlines study time by summarizing key content, generating quizzes and flashcards based on students’ study materials, and a responsive chatbot that answers questions based on students’ study materials. Markas (مركّز) also features an intelligent time-management tool to help students stay organized and avoid academic burnout. It supports accessibility features such as reading aloud text-to-speech features instead of reading and customizing fonts for dyslexic students.
